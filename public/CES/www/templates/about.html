                    Coordinated Entry System offers an organized, efficient approach to providing homeless families
                    with services and housing by linking them to programs and matching families' needs to providers' strengths and capacity.
                    United Way 211 performs a preliminary screening to determine a household's need for housing resources.
                    Eligible households are scheduled for an appointment with case manager for an assessment that will be conducted in a face to face interview at one of several pre-established countywide locations. CE staff will place families on a housing placement roster to receive services on a space available basis.
